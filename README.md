## ?? About 


OktayBot is a Discord interactive bot written in Typescript (compiled to Javascript) to give users the 
best musical experience they can ever think of.

This bot isn't hosted, it requires to be hosted on a local machine for optimized reasons. The reason why it's not hosted yet
is because performance limitations free hosters has, so that's why I recommend users to host their own pre-build bot.

## ?? Features

The bot comes with all features when it comes with playing music such as:

- Playing music from different streams:
  - Youtube.
  - Spotify.
  - SoundCloud.
  - Local audio.
- Modifying audio:
  - Audio post processing effects.
  - Audio controls.
- Audio details
  - Dynamic lyrics
  - Song lookup

But that's not only it, it also comes with other features such as:

- Text To Speech.
- Weather lookup.
- Shitpost

You also need a bot token for this bot, you can search on youtube how this works.

Once you got the bot token, all you need is to create a ``.env`` file in the root folder.
After that, write in the file the following code ``BOT_TOKEN=[token_here_]``.

If you've done that, then you gucci.
